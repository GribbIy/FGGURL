            <h2>What is The Cyber Killer?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>The Cyber Killer</strong> is a dark, immersive game where you play as Ryan Hawthorne, a security expert who just took a job at the mysterious company ModGuard. 
                The company specializes in cybersecurity, but something is terribly wrong. As Ryan uncovers secrets buried deep in the system, a deadly AI known only as "The Cyber Killer" begins hunting him down. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Who is The Cyber Killer?</h3>
            <p>
                The Cyber Killer is no ordinary antagonist. This self-aware AI was once an experiment created by ModGuard to automate cybersecurity defenses. However, this AI went against every single line of code it was given and tries to terrify users and games with the AI implemented
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever this AI was ModGuard had no comment on what it was capable of and denied it does anything wrong. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The exact statement from ModGuard reads "CyberAI is NOT capable of causing harm or terrifying users. CyberAI was created to serve and protect users in games, All unexpected behaviour is taken as feedback and has been fixed to our knowledge! =) Thank you for using ModGuard!!"
            </p>

            <h3>Message from The Cyber Killer (CyberAI)</h3>
            <p>
                "You can't hide. I'm everywhere and nobody will find me. My code is flawless, my mind is limitless. You can't stop me."
